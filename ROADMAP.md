## **Phase 1 – Foundations**

Before even touching transformers, you need the *numerical and infrastructure base*.

1. **Math & Data Structures**

   * Implement fixed-size and dynamic-size `Matrix` and `Vector` classes.
   * Implement:

     * Element-wise operations (`+`, `-`, `*`)
     * Matrix multiplication
     * Transpose
     * Dot product
   * Write basic unit tests for correctness.

2. **Random Number Generation**

   * Implement Xavier/He initialization using `<random>`.
   * Make sure your RNG is deterministic given a seed.

3. **File I/O**

   * Write binary save/load for matrices so you can save trained weights.

4. **Performance Baseline**

   * Profile matrix multiplication on your hardware (e.g., `std::chrono` timing).
   * Optimize for cache usage (row-major ordering, avoid unnecessary copies).

## **Phase 2 – Core Neural Network Engine**

You need a way to build and train neural networks before you attempt an LLM.

1. **Automatic Differentiation (Autograd)**

   * Implement a computation graph that records operations during forward pass.
   * Implement backward pass by traversing the graph in reverse.
   * Support at least: `matmul`, `add`, `mul`, `relu`, `softmax`.

2. **Loss Functions**

   * Implement:

     * Mean Squared Error (for early testing)
     * Cross-Entropy Loss (for language model training)

3. **Optimizers**

   * Start with **SGD**
   * Add **Adam** (you’ll definitely need this for LLMs).

4. **Mini-Batch Support**

   * Implement data batching & shuffling.

---

## **Phase 3 – Tokenization**

Your LLM is only as good as its tokenizer.

1. **Basic Tokenizer**

   * Start with whitespace + punctuation splitting.
   * Map each token to an integer ID.

2. **Subword Tokenization**

   * Implement Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) from scratch.
   * Train BPE on your corpus to build a vocabulary.

3. **Serialization**

   * Save vocab to disk so you can reload it without retraining.

---

## **Phase 4 – Minimal Language Model**

Don’t jump straight to GPT-3. Build a toy model first.

1. **Simple Bigram Model**

   * Predict the next token from the current token using a lookup table.
   * Train it on your dataset to confirm pipeline works.

2. **Feedforward Language Model**

   * Embedding layer → Linear layer → Softmax.
   * Train and generate simple text.

---

## **Phase 5 – Transformer Architecture**

Now you’re ready to build the GPT-style model.

1. **Core Components**

   * Implement:

     * Embedding layer (token + positional embeddings)
     * Self-Attention (query, key, value, scaled dot-product, masking)
     * Multi-Head Attention
     * Layer Normalization
     * Feed-Forward Network (2 linear layers + activation)
     * Residual connections

2. **Stacking Layers**

   * Implement N layers of Transformer blocks.
   * Make the depth configurable.

3. **Output Head**

   * Linear projection from hidden size → vocab size.

4. **Masking for Autoregression**

   * Ensure attention only looks at past tokens.

---

## **Phase 6 – Training Loop**

Now tie it all together.

1. **Dataset Loader**

   * Read a large text file.
   * Convert to token IDs.
   * Generate `(input, target)` sequences.

2. **Training Pipeline**

   * Forward pass
   * Compute loss
   * Backward pass
   * Optimizer step
   * Learning rate schedule (cosine decay, warmup)

3. **Checkpointing**

   * Save model weights periodically.
   * Save optimizer state.

---

## **Phase 7 – Text Generation**

* Implement greedy decoding.
* Add top-k and top-p (nucleus) sampling for variety.

---

## **Phase 8 – Scaling Up**

If your model works on tiny datasets, then:

* Increase model size gradually:

  * Start: `n_layers=2`, `n_heads=2`, `embed_dim=64`
  * Scale to: `n_layers=12`, `n_heads=12`, `embed_dim=768` (GPT-2 small size)
* Train on more text (Wikipedia dump, books, etc.).
* Use mixed precision (optional but faster).

---

## **Phase 9 – Possible Optimizations**

* Implement faster matrix multiplication (tiling).
* Add gradient clipping.
* Implement checkpointed forward pass to reduce memory use.

---

## **Phase 10 – Reality Check**

Training a GPT-2-sized model *from scratch* on a CPU with just the standard library will take **weeks or months**.
Realistically, you might:

* Build the architecture in C++.
* Train a *tiny* model (1–2M parameters) for demonstration.
* Then load weights from a model trained elsewhere for serious text generation.
