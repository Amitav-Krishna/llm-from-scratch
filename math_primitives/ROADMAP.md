Math & Data Structures

    Implement fixed-size and dynamic-size Matrix and Vector classes.

    Implement:

        Element-wise operations (+, -, *)

        Matrix multiplication

        Transpose

        Dot product

    Write basic unit tests for correctness.

Random Number Generation

    Implement Xavier/He initialization using <random>.

    Make sure your RNG is deterministic given a seed.

File I/O

    Write binary save/load for matrices so you can save trained weights.

Performance Baseline

    Profile matrix multiplication on your hardware (e.g., std::chrono timing).

    Optimize for cache usage (row-major ordering, avoid unnecessary copies).
